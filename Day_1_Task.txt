1) Differenece between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1

 * HTTP1.1 is HyperText Transfer Protocol.
 * HTTP1.1 is original version of HTTP protocols which is used for communication between web server
   and client such as web browsers.
 * It introduced standadization,new features and improved new efficiencey of protocols through the
   better caching,encoding,reusing of HTTP connections,and pipeling HTTP request.
 * It loads resources one after other,so if one resources cannot be loaded,it blocks all other resources
   behind it.
 * It works on textual format.
 * It uses requests resources Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
 * It compresses data by itself.
 * Client (browser) has send a request to server using GET & POST method. 
 * Server responds with requested resources.
   For Example :Image alongside the status of what it did to the client's request.
 * Persistent connetions:
     It supports persistent connections, which allows multiple request and response can be sent 
	 to over same TCP connections.This reduces the overhead of establishing the new connections 
	 for each and every request and improving the performance of protocols.
 * Pipelining:
    It supports pipelining,which allows multiple request can be sent without waiting corresponding
	response.This reduce latency of protocols and improves the performance.
 * Caching:
    It introduced several caching features , including the ability to specify cache control directives,
	which can reduce the amount of data that needs to transmitted between client and server.
 * Chunked Transfer encoding :
    It is ability to transfer the large amount of data in chunks , which can improve the efficiency of 
	data transfer and reduce the latency.
 * Improved error handling:
    It introduced more detailed error codes and improved error handling , which can help the developers troubleshoot
	and resolve the issues more quickly.


HTTP2:
 
 * HTTP2 is HyperText Transfer protocols version 2.
 * HTTP2 can send multiple stream of data at once using single TCP connections so that no resources
   block any other resource.
 * It works on binary protocols.
 * It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
 * It uses HPACK for data compressions.
 * It was designes to address some limitations and performance issue of HTTP1.1 and improve the speed 
   and efficiency of web communications.
 * Multiplexing:
     . It allows the multiple request and response to single connections ,which can be  improves the
	   performance of protocols by reducing the overhead of established new connections.
 * Binary protocols:
     . It uses binary protocols instead of text based protocols.It reduces the size of data transmitted between
	   client and server improving the efficiency of protocols.
 * Header Compression:
     . It uses header compression to reduce the size of header data which is significant in HTTP1.1.
	 . It also improves the efficiency of protocols and reduce the latency.
 * Server push:
     . It sends multiple response to single request, which can improve the speed and efficiency of 
	 web applications.
 Prioritization:
     . It allows client to specify the priority of request , which can improve the responsiveness
	   of protocols and reduce the latency.

Drawbacks of HTTP2:

    * Implemetation complexity.
	* Server resource consumption.
	* Interoperatability issues.
	* Security concerns.
	* Performace limitations.
	
	
2) what is objects?

 * Objects is like a containers that holds the different property.
 * Objects stores the elements as a Key-value pair.
 * Each key-value pair termed as "Property".
 * Objects represents the curly braces {}.
 * If you need to retrieve the specify data use dot operator.
 
 Examples for objects:
 
 var bike ={color:"black",milege:40,wheels:2,brand:"RX100"};
 console.log(bike.color);
 
 output:black.
 
 console.log(bike.milege,bike.brand);
 
 output:40,RX100.
 
 console.log(bike);
 
 output:{color:"black",milege:40,wheels:2,brand:"RX100"}.
